# Github Commands


## GitHub Branches Structure:

- Main: Contain the tested stable production ready code.
- Development: Integration branch where all feature branches are merged after review. Contains work-in-progress but mostly functional code.
- yourname/feature-name: Personal feature branches. On which the one working.

## GitHub Work flow

1. Start New Work

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/moinBukhari147/reshta-frontend.git
    git checkout develop
    git pull origin develop
    git checkout -b yourname/feature-name
```

2. Push and Work

````bash
    git push -u origin yourname/feature-name
    ```
````

3. Open a Pull Request

- Once your feature is ready, open a PR from your branch into develop on GitHub.
- Tag a reviewer and fix any issues before merging.

4. Merge to Develop

- After approval and testing, your branch is merged into develop.

5. Release to Main

6. After Merge Cleanup

```bash
    git branch -d yourname/feature-name
    git push origin --delete yourname/feature-name

```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

Always branch from develop, not from your last feature.

Pull latest changes before starting new work.

Keep PRs small and focused to reduce review time and conflicts.

Use meaningful branch names, like yourname/login-screen or collab/otp-bugfix.
